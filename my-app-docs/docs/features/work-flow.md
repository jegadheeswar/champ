# Work Flow

Automate your cloud infrastructure deployments with visual workflow builder.

---

## Overview

The **Work Flow** feature lets you connect to cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure), scan existing resources, select modules, configure them, and deploy — all from a single interface.

### Supported Providers

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**
- **Microsoft Azure**

## How It Works

The workflow is divided into 5 simple steps:

1. **Connection** — Connect to your cloud account
2. **Existing Resources** — View resources already deployed via IaC (Terraform)
3. **Modules** — Select which cloud resources to deploy
4. **Configure** — Customize module settings
5. **Create** — Deploy your infrastructure
