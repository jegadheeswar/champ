# AWS Connection

Connect to your AWS account by providing credentials.

---

## Step 1: AWS Credentials

Enter your AWS IAM credentials:

- **AWS Access Key ID** — From your IAM user
- **AWS Secret Access Key** — From your IAM user
- **Region** — Where your resources will be deployed (e.g., `us-east-1`)

> 🔐 All credentials are encrypted and stored securely.

## Step 2: Test Connection

Click **Test Connection** to verify your credentials.

✅ If successful, you’ll see a green checkmark.

> 💡 Pro Tip: Use **IAM Roles** for production environments — they’re more secure than access keys.

Let me know if you’d like to add **multi-account support** or **SSO integration** next!
