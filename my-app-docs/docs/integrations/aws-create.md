# Deploy Your Resources

You’re now ready to deploy your configured AWS resources.

---

## Review Your Configuration

Before clicking **Create**, review your deployment summary:

### Deployment Summary

- **Provider**: AWS
- **Region**: `us-east-1`
- **Modules**: 1 (e.g., VPC + S3)
- **Estimated Monthly Cost**: `$73.00`

> 💡 This is an estimate — actual cost may vary based on usage.

---

## Step 1: Click “Create Resources”

Click the **orange “Create Resources”** button to start the deployment.

✅ You’ll see a progress bar and real-time logs.

---

## Step 2: Monitor Deployment

While deploying:
- Watch the **progress bar** complete
- View **logs** for detailed status
- Check for **success or error messages**

> ⏳ Deployment may take 2–5 minutes.

---

## Step 3: Verify Deployment

Once deployed:
- Go to **Dashboard > Clusters** to see your new resources
- Use **Masa Bot** to ask, “Did my AWS resources deploy successfully?”
- View **Logs** for any warnings or errors

---

## Step 4: Manage Your Resources

After deployment:
- **Edit** resources in **Work Flow > Existing Resources**
- **Delete** resources via the **Actions** column
- **Scale** resources (e.g., add more EC2 instances)

## Best Practices

✅ Always review your deployment summary before creating  
✅ Use **Masa Bot** to automate deployments — say, “Deploy VPC, S3, and Lambda with default settings.”  
✅ Monitor costs regularly — use **Dashboard > Costs** to track spending

---

> 💡 Pro Tip: Use **CloudTrail** to audit all API activity and ensure compliance.
